# Weather Analyzer Application
A graphical user interface (GUI) application for analyzing weather data and air quality index (AQI) information. The app retrieves real-time weather data and AQI from the [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/) and [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/). It provides visualizations and analytics features for weather data and air quality data.

## Features

- **Real-Time Data:** Fetches current weather and air quality data from reliable APIs.
- **Interactive Maps:** Visualize the location of searched cities/states with an interactive map view.
- **Graphical Plots:** Analyze temperature trends and historical air quality data through graphical plots.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive interface for effortless navigation and data exploration.
